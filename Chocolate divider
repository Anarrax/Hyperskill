/* Imagine a chocolate bar. Remember how it is usually split into smaller bits by a special grid?

Now think of chocolate as an N x M rectangle divided into little segments: N segments in length and M in width. Each segment is 1x1 and unbreakable. 
Find out whether it is possible to break off exactly K segments from the chocolate with a single straight line: vertical or horizontal.

Input data format
The program gets an input of three integers: N, M, K.

Output data format
The program must output one of the two words: YES or NO. */
